# Face Detection Deep Learning
Implementation of a face detector based on a convolutional neural network


## Aim

This project offers a deep system to detect faces from images using a base of reduced size images. We have been able to obtain encouraging results despite some small difficulties due to the limitations of our methods but which are leading to future improvements.

Since this is also a class project, we wanted to learn the several things from it :

- Learn hard functionalities of Python; 
- Training: Implement many models of neural networks to obtain good results; 
- Crop and Scale algorithms to classify faces in images.
- Algorithms of clustering such as DBSCAN and MeanShift.
- OpenCV functionnalities for showing images and create rectangles when finding face.

## Running the project:

### Prerequisites

	- Python 3.6
	- Tensorflow/TFlearn
	- Ideally, a GNU/Linux based operating system, though the code is meant to be portable
  

### Execution

##### Simple Image :

- Console mode:
	+ access the project repository in the console  
	+ run "console_mode_launch.py" with the python interpreter in you installed everything.

- Graphical mode:
  + run "launch.py" with the python interpreter in you installed everything.
  
 ##### Repository of images :
 
 - Console mode:
	+ access the project repository in the console  
	+ run "console_mode_launch.py" with the python interpreter in you installed everything.

- Graphical mode:
  + run "launch.py" with the python interpreter in you installed everything.
